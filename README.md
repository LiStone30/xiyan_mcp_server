# XiYan MCP Server


A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables natural language queries to databases, powered by [XiYanSQL](https://github.com/XGenerationLab/XiYan-SQL) as text-to-sql technique (SOTA of text-to-sql open benchmarks).

We support MySQL database now and more dialects are coming soon.

## 1. Features
- Fetch data by natural language through [XiYanSQL](https://github.com/XGenerationLab/XiYan-SQL)
- List available MySQL tables as resources
- Read table contents

## 2. Tool Preview
 - The tool ``get_data_via_natural_language`` provides a natural language interface for retrieving data from a database. This server will convert the input natural language into SQL using a built-in model and call the database to return the query results.

 - The ``mysql://{table_name}`` resource allows obtaining a portion of sample data from the database for model reference when a specific table_name is specified.
- The ``mysql://`` resource will list the names of the current databases

## 3. Installation
### 3.1 Install from pip

Python 3.11+ is required. 
you can install the server through pip, and it will install the latest verion

```bash
pip install xiyan-mcp-server
```

After that you can directly run the server by:
```bash
python -m xiyan_mcp_server
```
But it does not provide any functions until you complete following config.
You will get a yml file. After that you can run the server by:
```yaml
env YML=path/to/yml python -m xiyan_mcp_server
```


### 3.2 Install from Smithery.ai
See [@XGenerationLab/xiyan_mcp_server](https://smithery.ai/server/@XGenerationLab/xiyan_mcp_server)

Not fully tested.

## 4. Configuration

You need a yml config file to configure the server.
a default config file is provided in config_demo.yml which looks like this:

```yaml
model:
  name: "pre-xiyan_multi_dialect_v3"
  key: ""
  url: "https://poc-dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"

database:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 3306
  user: "root"
  password: ""
  database: ""
```

### 4.1 About LLM
``Name`` is the name of the model to use, ``key`` is the API key of the model, ``url`` is the API url of the model. We support following models.
#### Using general LLMs
if you want to use the general LLMs, e.g. gpt3.5, you can directly config like this:
```yaml
model:
  name: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  key: "YOUR KEY "
  url: "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
database:
```

if you want to use Qwen from alibaba, e.g. Qwen-max,
```yaml
model:
  name: "qwen-max"
  key: "YOUR KEY "
  url: "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
database:
```
#### Using Text-to-SQL SOTA model
Last, we recommend the XiYanSQL-qwencoder-32B (https://github.com/XGenerationLab/XiYanSQL-QwenCoder), which is the SOTA model in text-to-sql.
We deployed the model on Alibaba Cloud DashScope, so you need to set the following environment variables:
Contact us to get the ``key``. ( godot.lzl@alibaba-inc.com )
```yaml
model:
  name: "pre-xiyan_multi_dialect_v3"
  key: "KEY"
  url: "https://poc-dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
database:
```

Alternatively, you can also deploy the model (XiYanSQL-qwencoder-32B) on your own server.

#### Local LLMs
To support in the future.

### 4.2 About the database
``host``, ``port``, ``user``, ``password``, ``database`` are the connection information of the MySQL database.

You can use local or any remote databases. Now we support MySQL (more dialects soon).


```yaml
database:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 3306
  user: "root"
  password: ""
  database: ""
```
